# Phosphorus-basin-dataset
Supporting basin data for the phosphorus study in the US.

The supporting data include basic basin information and a series of basin characteristics of topography, climate, hydrology, land use, soil, and geology processed from the Caravan (https://github.com/kratzert/Caravan). 

Basin characteristics include basin elevation, slope, stream gradient, annual average of air temperature, precipitation, potential and actual evapotranspiration, global aridity index, climate moisture index, snow cover extent, natural discharge, land surface runoff, land use percentages of forest, cropland, pasture, irrigated area, permafrost, and wetland, soil component percentages of sand, silt, clay, and organic carbon content, soil erosion, and lithological classes and karst area extent, among others.
